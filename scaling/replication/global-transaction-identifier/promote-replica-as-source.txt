## Scenario
-- consider exists a source, and replica1, replica2, replica3,
-- then source is offline and replica1 need to be promoted become new source

## Initial setup when replica is running
-- replicas disable replica log update --log-replica-updates=OFF

## Promote replica1 by stop the replica and reset master, replica1:
mysql> STOP REPLICA
mysql> RESET MASTER

## Make sure all replicas process any statements in their relay log, each replica:
mysql> STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST -- until you see "Has read all relay log"

## Change other replica source, replica2:
mysql> STOP REPLICA
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST='replica1' ...
mysql> START REPLICA



## If "source" available, then make it as replica1:
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST='replica1' ...



## Consider making source (currently as replica1) as source again
-- use the preceding procedure as if replica1 (currently as source) was unavailable
-- and source (currently as replica1) was to be the new source, in source (currently as replica1):
mysql> STOP REPLICA
mysql> RESET MASTER

## Make replica1 (currently source) as original replica1:
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST='source' ...
